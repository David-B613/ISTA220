1. What is a class? According to the book, what does a class "arrange?"

* **An class is the blueprint for a specific object. Arrange systematically put information and behavior into a meaningful entity **

2. What are the two purposes of *encapsulation*?

* **To combine methods and data within a class; in other words, to support classification and
To control the accessibility of the methods and data; in other words, to control the use of the class.**

3. How do you *instantiate* an instance of a class? How do you access that instance?

* **It creates an instance of a class and calls the methods of that class. As long as those methods do what they are designed to do, the program does not need to know how they are implemented.**

4. What is the default access of the fields and methods of a class? How do you change the default?

* **Internal is the default access but there are four other access modifiers.**

5. What is the syntax for writing a *constructor*?

* **Constructor(s) must match the name of the class**

6. What is the difference between class fields and methods, and instance fields and methods? How do you create class fields and methods?

* **Class is a type, methods are actions, and instance fields are things such as the name, age, and true or false statements that are relevant to the class.**

7. How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a static class in scope?

* **Static using statements allow you to bring a class into scope and omit the class name when accessing static members. **

8. Can you think of a good reason to create an *anonymous class* What is it?

* **When you are using query expressions.**

9. What is *polymorphism* as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.

* **It is the ability to change. This is a reference to the programming language interpret objects in various ways based on their characteristics such as
class type or data type. **

10. What is *message passing* as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.

* **A technique for invoking a behavior.**

11. What was the first object-oriented programming language?

 * **sybliya**

 12. Consider this quote by Alexander Stephanov:

      I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces
      that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multi-sorted algebras
      families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It
      everything is an object is saying nothing at all.

      Who is Alexander Stephanov? What do you think about this quote?

      * **I do not truly understand this statement. What I get from this is that he does not agree with OOP. I do not have enough knoweldge about the current situation in order to make a fair statement of my own.**
